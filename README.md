# Selenium → Playwright Migrator MCP

Standalone **MCP stdio server and agent skill** for Selenium C# NUnit → Playwright .NET migration. It uses the versioned [Migrator Core](https://github.com/AlexanderLevenskikh/selenium-playwright-migrator-core) NuGet API rather than referencing the engine source projects.

Imported from [selenium-playwright-ast-migrator](https://github.com/AlexanderLevenskikh/selenium-playwright-ast-migrator), pinned source commit `a8b102072196f85bf85d785795aef22296c4deca`.

## MCP tools

- `analyze_migration(source, config?)`: source inventory, blockers, hashes and findings.
- `explain_finding(source, findingId, config?, expectedAnalysisId?)`: source excerpt, diagnostic evidence and suggested next action.
- `preview_migration(source, config?, expectedAnalysisId?)`: read-only conservative target draft, hashes, TODOs and residual findings.

The server **never applies edits**. No compile/run/behavior claims are made for preview. `verify_artifact` and agent-edited target verification are roadmap items. Inputs with multiple fixtures or unsupported xUnit source are counted but blocked.

## Local build before Core is published to NuGet

CI uses Core commit `8e2e0a450497440960496338ebdd0b1f2e93e4e5` for the local package feed, verified independently in its own repository. To reproduce the build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexanderLevenskikh/selenium-playwright-migrator-core.git core
git -C core checkout 8e2e0a450497440960496338ebdd0b1f2e93e4e5
mkdir -p artifacts/nuget
for project in Migrator.Core Migrator.Roslyn Migrator.SeleniumCSharp Migrator.PlaywrightDotNet Migrator.Application; do
  dotnet pack "core/$project/$project.csproj" -c Release -o artifacts/nuget
done
dotnet restore Migrator.Mcp/Migrator.Mcp.csproj --source "$PWD/artifacts/nuget" --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
dotnet build Migrator.Mcp/Migrator.Mcp.csproj -c Release --no-restore
MIGRATOR_WORKSPACE=/absolute/path/to/selenium-tests dotnet run --project Migrator.Mcp/Migrator.Mcp.csproj -c Release --no-build
```

Core packages are **preview build artifacts**, not yet published to public NuGet.

## MCP client configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "selenium-playwright-migrator": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp/Migrator.Mcp/bin/Release/net10.0/Migrator.Mcp.dll"],
      "env": {
        "MIGRATOR_WORKSPACE": "/absolute/path/to/selenium-tests"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The environment variable must contain an **absolute existing workspace** path. Tool arguments use workspace-relative paths. Stdout is reserved for MCP JSON-RPC.

See the included [agent skill](skills/selenium-playwright-migration/SKILL.md). The integration smoke validates initialize, tool discovery/calls, path boundaries, stale analyses and unsupported source shapes.
